Dynatrace

APM with proactive , reactive support.
synthetic monitoring - loading of pages - licensed
Real user monitoring - not used GDPR


Architecture:
DT Cluster: 3 nodes
WebUI & Control services - query from UI, Analytics services, cassandra NoSQL services, Nginx, Agent security services   -- each nodes

Cluster mgmt console -- only DT admins
Mission control monitoring -- Dynatrace folks can view the setup etc. Access can be revoked on request. Reactive support is still applicable, but not proactive support.


Agents use 8443 https to transmit data

Configurable:
purepaths - 10days   --- disk storage

Timeseries: CPU, memory, processtime, failure rate
1 min intervals -14 d
5min - 28 d+
1hr - 400 d
1 day - 5 yrs

Real user mgmt - Elasticsearch store : No. of user clicks etc.
sessions - 30d
Waterfall - 10d - first resource loaded on UI

Dynatrace clusters sent heartbeat messages to DT mission control . Updates are pushed to mission control, clusters pull the updates from MC.
heartbeat data - usage for billing, health stats, heardware utilization, CPU, events like updates, server restarts, removed nodes etc.

OneAgent updates are optional - 4 week updates - restart required! valid for one year
DT servers have audit logs to see user logins

Data retention - 35 days default - configurable

The oneAgent is also installed on the DT cluster itself, So that MC can view the health stats of the DT cluster.

Security Gateway: Sits in front of the DT cluster. all OneAgents connect to the SG to talk to DT cluster. No need to open firewall to multiple agents.
70% reduction in network traffic.

Agentless RUM requires SG to push data to the DT. Since there is no agent in the browser, the data cant be pushed to the DT server/cluster.

OneAgents are aware of all SGs. Firewall needs to be configured to ensure that the agent connects to desired SGs.
